## General Information

* Nothing so far...

## Main Teaching Reference
While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version.  We generally recommed you to use these amazing ressources for problem-solfing and further self-study on the topic.

# Modules
The course is structured in 3 modules, where their content can be found in the corresponding subfolders

## [M1: Applied Data Science and Machine Learning](https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/M1)

This module will prove a condensed introduction to the “Data Science Pipeline”, introducing students to methods, techniques, and workflows in applied data analytics and machine learning, including data acquisition, preparation, analysis, visualization, and communication.

## [M2: Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing](https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/M2)
Focuses on analyzing a variety of unstructured data sources. Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.

## [M3: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Analytics](https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/M3)
Introduces to the most recent developments in machine learning, which are deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. The module will provide a solid foundation for this exciting and rapidly developing field. Students will learn whether and how to apply deep learning techniques for business analytics, and acquire proficiency in new methods autonomously.
