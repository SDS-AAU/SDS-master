# Preamble

## Standard packages

```{r}
### Load packages
library(tidyverse) # Collection of all the good stuff like dplyr, ggplot2 ect.
library(magrittr) # For extra-piping operators (eg. %<>%)
```

## Load data

Trips

```{r}
trips <- read_csv('https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/M1/data/trips.csv')
```

```{r}
trips %>% glimpse()
```

People

```{r}
people <- read_csv('https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/M1/data/people.csv')
```

```{r}
people %>% glimpse()
```

Countries

```{r}
countries <- read_csv( 'https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/M1/data/countrylist.csv')
```

```{r}
countries %>% glimpse()
```

# 1: Preprocessing

## a. Trips: transform dates into timestamps

```{r}
trips %>% select(date_start, date_end) %>%
  glimpse()
```

`readr` is smart, so if you loaded the data with `read_csv`, then this is already taken care of. Otherwise:

```{r}
# To demonstrate, I transform it back to a string.
trips %<>% mutate(date_start = date_start %>% as.character(),
                  date_end = date_end %>% as.character())
```

```{r}
trips %>% select(date_start, date_end) %>%
  glimpse()
```

In case it is a string but well formated, we can use the `lubridate` packages.

```{r}
library(lubridate) # This is tidyverse's datetime package

trips %<>% mutate(date_start = date_start %>% as_date(),
                  date_end = date_end %>% as_date())
```

```{r}
trips %>% select(date_start, date_end) %>%
  glimpse()
```

## b. Calculate trip duration in days

```{r}
trips %<>% mutate(trip_duration = date_end - date_start)
```

```{r}
# Test if it works
trips %>% 
  select(trip_duration, date_start, date_end) %>%
  head()
```

Seems to work fine :)

## c. Filter extreme (fake?) observations for durations as well as dates - start and end

Lets inspect:

```{r}
trips %>% 
  select(trip_duration, date_start, date_end) %>%
  summary()
```

We clearly see that some observations areunrealistic (trip in Jesus's times or in the future etc.). Lets look at the distribution

```{r}
trips %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date_start)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
trips %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date_end)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

There are many ways to deal with outliers. To make it simple:

1: We could filter by some minimum / maximum date set manually
2: We could just delete extreme values using `percentage_rank` (deleting the 1 percent of obs with highest/lowest values). We will demonstrate this here:

```{r}
trips %<>%
  mutate(date_start_pct = date_start %>% as.numeric() %>% percent_rank(),
         date_end_pct = date_end %>% as.numeric() %>% percent_rank()) %>%
  filter(date_start_pct >= 0.01 & date_start_pct <= 0.99) %>%
  filter(date_end_pct >= 0.01 & date_end_pct <= 0.99) 
```

Lets check how it looks now:

```{r}
trips %>% 
  select(trip_duration, date_start, date_end) %>%
  summary()
```

We clearly see that some observations areunrealistic (trip in Jesus's times or in the future etc.). Lets look at the distribution

```{r}
trips %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date_start)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
```{r}
trips %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date_end)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Way more realistic, right?

## d. Join the countrylist data to the trips data-frame using the countrycode as a key

A simple left join.Be only aware of the different variable names

```{r}
trips %<>%
  left_join(countries, by = c("country_code" = "alpha_2"))
```

```{r}
trips %>% head()
```

New variables are in, seems to work. Lets check if there are some trips that could not match:

```{r}
trips %>% filter(is.na(region) | is.na(sub_region))
```

```{r}
trips %>% filter(is.na(region) | is.na(sub_region)) %>%
  count(country_code, sort = TRUE)
```

Ok, we see some country codes did not match. We dont bother for most small numbers, but one thing we might take a look at: UK did not match, since it is coded GB in the countries dataframe (Just inspect it). Lets delete the newly matched variables and start over again.

```{r}
trips %<>% 
  select(-region, -sub_region)
```

Lets replace UK with GB

```{r}
trips %<>% 
  mutate(country_code = country_code %>% str_replace(pattern = 'UK', replacement = 'GB'))
```

```{r}
trips %>%
  filter(country_code == 'UK' |country_code == 'GB') %>%
  count(country_code)
```

Ok, no more UK present... lets join again.

```{r}
trips %<>%
  left_join(countries, by = c("country_code" = "alpha_2"))
```

```{r}
trips %>% filter(is.na(region) | is.na(sub_region)) %>%
  count(country_code, sort = TRUE)
```

Ok, the rest seems negligible... we just delete these observations...

```{r}
trips %<>% drop_na(region)
```

# 2: People

```{r}
people %>% glimpse()
```


## a: How many people have a least a “High School” diploma?

Lets see what educations we have in the data

```{r}
people %>% count(education_raw)
```

Ok, that seems easy. Since all educations include Highschool (or higher), we can just assume that everybody that has all people with a non-missing education field have at least a highschool degree.

```{r}
sum(!is.na(people$education_raw))
```

However, for the rest we just dont know...

## b. How many “Startup Founders” have attained a “Master’s Degree”?

```{r}
people %>% count(work_raw, sort = TRUE)
```


We cannot just filter for the string, since it is contained in multiple categories. We have to instead detect all strings where "Spartup Founder" appears. HEre we need the `stringr` package.

```{r}
people %>% 
  filter(work_raw %>% str_detect('Startup Founder')) %>% 
  head()
```

```{r}
people %>% 
  filter(education_raw %>% str_detect('Master\'s Degree')) %>% head()

# Notice the needed escape sign \ before the '
```

Putting it together and counting

```{r}
people %>% 
  filter(work_raw %>% str_detect('Startup Founder') & education_raw %>% str_detect('Master\'s Degree') ) %>%
  summarise(n = n())

```

Its 53...

# 3. Trips

```{r}
trips %>% glimpse()
```


## a. Which country received the highest number of trips? – And which the lowest?

Thats easy...

```{r}
trips %>%
  count(country_code) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  head()
```

The US recieves the most trips.

```{r}
trips %>%
  count(country_code) %>%
  arrange(n) %>%
  head()
```

Hmm, all some weird country codes... we could no filter them for only official ones... but lets leave it like that for now...

## b. Which region received the highest number of trips in 2017? Use the start of trips as a time reference.

Since the dates are already datetimes, we can just extract the year with the year() function of lubridate.

```{r}
trips %>%
  filter(year(date_start) == 2017) %>%
  count(country_code, sort = TRUE)
```
Its again the US.

## c. Which country in “Western Europe” did travelers spent least time? – Provide visualization

```{r}
trips %>%
  filter(sub_region == 'Western Europe') %>%
#  count(country_code, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = country_code)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Could be done pettier, though


## d. Do nomad Startup Founders tend to have shorter or longer trips on average?

* Here, we first need to do a join with the people dataframe.
* Then we only have to create a founder dummy variable and summarize.

```{r}
trips %>% 
  left_join(people %>% select(username, work_raw), by = 'username') %>%
  mutate(founder = work_raw %>% str_detect('Startup Founder')) %>%
  group_by(founder) %>%
  summarize(duration_mean = trip_duration %>% mean(na.rm = TRUE))
```
Indeed, it seems they on average have the shortest trips... busy people....

## e. visualize over-time median trip duration overall (bonus: and split by world-region) The plot will look weird ^^.
