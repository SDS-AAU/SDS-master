## This session 

Welcome to your first part of the introduction to network analysis. In this session you will learn:

1. Why applying network analysis is helpful to answer certain questions.
2. Why framing certain contexts as networks gives new insights.
3. The basic structure of relational data.
4. How to construct graph objects from different datasources.
5. How to analyse basic features of nodes, edges, and graphs.
6. How to identify groups and communities in graphs.
7. How to do simple network visualizations.

# Introduction

## Networks... so what?

## The basic jargon

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# If you see this code, dont worry about it. Its just to create the visual
tibble(from = c(1,2,3,1), to = c(3,1,5,5), text = rep("Edge", 4)) %>% 
  as_tbl_graph() %N>%
  mutate(text = "Node") %>%
  ggraph(layout = "nicely") +
  geom_node_point(size = 10, col = "skyblue") + 
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name)) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(label = text, alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE)) +
  theme_graph() +
  labs(title = "What is a network?", subtitle = "A system of elements (nodes/vertices) and connections (edges) between them") +
  geom_mark_ellipse(aes(x, y, label = "Node / Vertex", 
                        description = "Elements in the system",
                        filter = name == 1)) 
```

* *Plainly speaking, a network is a **system** of **elements** which are connected by some **relationship**. 
* The whole system is called a **network** or **graph**. 
The elements are commonly referred to as **nodes** (system theory jargon) or **vertices** (graph theory jargon) of a graph.
The connections are **edges** or **links**.
