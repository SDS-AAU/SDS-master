# Data representations for neural networks

## Tensors



* Most current DL frameworks use **tensors** as their basic data structure. 
* Tensors are fundamental to the field-so fundamental that Google's **TensorFlow** was named after them. So what's a tensor?
* Tensors are a generalization of vectors and matrices to an arbitrary number of dimensions (note that in the context of tensors, a dimension is often called an axis). * A tensor is defined by three key attributes:
   1. **Number of axes** (rank): For instance, a 3D tensor has three axes, and a matrix has two axes.
   2. **Shape:** This is an integer vector that describes how many dimensions the tensor has along each axis. 
   3. **Data type:** This is the type of the data contained in the tensor; for instance, a tensor's type could be integer or double. On rare occasions, you may see a character tensor.

## Tensors and dimensionality

* **Scalars (0D tensors):**  A tensor that contains only one number is called a scalar (or scalar tensor, or zero-dimensional tensor, or 0D tensor). 
* **Vectors (1D tensors):** A one-dimensional array of numbers is called a vector, or 1D tensor. A 1D tensor is said to have exactly one axis. 
* **Matrices (2D tensors):** A two-dimensional array of numbers is a matrix.
