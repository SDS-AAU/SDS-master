### Intro to Convolutional Neural Nets
###### Roman Jurowetzki

Let's start by unpacking what visual data actually is: Images are matrices!

- That means that actually we have all the information about what is on the image right there in numbers describing each and every pixel, right? Wrong!

- The problem with images that the morst important information is not the what we can learn from each pixel but from the spatial interaction between them.

---


- Thus, the (relevant) information contained in an image is not the sum of all pixel values.


- The currently most widely used and extremely well performing approach to computer vision is convolution and more specifically deep convolutional neural networks.

To understand what the relevant features are hidden in the image we need to understand how individual pixels interact â€“ We need to identify patterns.

- For this we use convolutions. This explanation will be rather simplistic but good enough for our purposes.

- Now, imagine you make a large banner with a rectangular hole in it and start sliding it over that brick wall - left to right, up to down. Obviously, you will see some very different patterns at different times. Every time you see something interesting, you note it down. That's convolution in a nutshell:

A really [great post](https://medium.com/impactai/cnns-from-different-viewpoints-fab7f52d159c
) about CNN from different viewpoints: 

- Imagine now, instead of one window, you have many windows with different shapes to detect different features...

### Adding MaxPooling

> The pooling operation used in convolutional neural networks is a big mistake and the fact that it works so well is a disaster. - Geoffrey Hinton

- Convolution is great. But what if we want to capture information about the same objects but they are in different perspectives?

### Max pooling helps us


*   preserve features
*   achieve spacial invariance
*   reduce size and number of parameters (preventing overfitting)

- Now, let's check out [something fun:](http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/)

- The final layer is creating the input we need for a neural net - it's a simple flattening operation

- From here we using an ANN for classification or regression...or whatever you are able to put together...

- The end.
